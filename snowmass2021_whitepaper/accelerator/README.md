- (a) Record CW behavior for Nb$_3$Sn coated with the solid state diffusion method at Fermilab showed $E_{acc}$ =  23 MV/m.  Excellent performance was obtained by making a smooth thin film about 1~$\mu$m. (b) Measurements of the critical RF field of Nb$_3$Sn using high power pulsed RF.  The high temperature results extrapolate to a maximum surface magnetic field of 300 mT, which would translate to $E_{acc}$ = 85 MV/m for a Low-Loss shape cavity.
